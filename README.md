# StarCraft II: Ladder Bots

This is an attempt to set up a ladder system where bots can square off against each other, much like what is done on [sc2ai.net](https://sc2ai.net/).

The point is ultimately to make an easily-deployable framework (e.g., on Kubernetes or an arbitrary virtual machine) where this can be used in a classroom setting. Students studying reinforcement learning can build their bots, upload them to the ladder server, and have the server play their bots against each other.
